# Task: Build a Weather App

#### Description: Build a weather app that allows users to search for the current weather conditions for a given location. The app should display the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather data. Users should also be able to view a 5-day forecast for the selected location.

### Backend Requirements:

### Build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express
- Integrate with a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap)
- Implement caching to reduce the number of requests to external APIs
### Frontend Requirements:

### Build a frontend using Next.js and React
- Use a UI framework (such as Material-UI) to build the app interface
- Implement client-side routing to allow for dynamic page updates
- Use Context or another state management library to manage application state
### Bonus Features:

- Implement geolocation to automatically display weather data for the user's current location
- Build a toggle switch to allow users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units
- Add more detailed weather data, such as sunrise and sunset times, air pressure, and visibility.
